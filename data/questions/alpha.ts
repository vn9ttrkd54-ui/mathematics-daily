    answer: "A",
    solution: String.raw`Drawing a right triangle, the vertical distance from Legosi's eyes to the top of the tree is

    question: String.raw`Collot is riding an old bicycle whose front wheel has three times the radius of its back wheel. Assuming both wheels roll without slipping, if the back wheel completes \(120\) revolutions per minute, how many revolutions per minute does the front wheel complete?`,
    choices: ["360", "40", "120", "240", "NOTA"],
    answer: "B",
    solution: String.raw`Because both wheels roll without slipping, they have the same linear speed. If the back-wheel radius is \(r\), the front-wheel radius is \(3r\). Thus
\[3r\omega_F=r\omega_B,\]
so \(\omega_F=\frac13\omega_B\). Therefore the front wheel completes

    choices: ["4", "8", "12", "6", "NOTA"],
    answer: "C",
    solution: String.raw`By the Law of Sines,
\[\frac{\sin 30^\circ}{k}=\frac{\sin C}{10},\]
so \(\sin C=\frac5k\). If \(k<5\), there is no triangle; if \(k=5\), there is one right triangle; and if \(5<k<10\), both the acute and obtuse values of \(C\) produce triangles. When \(k\ge10\), the obtuse candidate would make \(A+C\ge180^\circ\), so only the acute candidate works. Among the choices, only \(k=12\) produces exactly one triangle. Thus \(k=\boxed{12}\).`,

Because \(\beta\) is in Quadrant IV,
\[\sin\beta=-\sqrt{1-\left(\frac5{13}\right)^2}=-\frac{12}{13}.\]

\[B^2-4AC=(-4)^2-4(3)(5)=-44<0.\]
Therefore the conic is an ellipse. Because the \(xy\)-coefficient is nonzero, the ellipse is rotated and is not a circle. Hence it is a \(\boxed{\text{non-circular ellipse}}\).`,

    question: String.raw`An ellipse is centered at \((0,0)\), has a focus at \((2,0)\), and passes through \((2,3)\). Find its area.`,
    choices: [String.raw`\(16\pi\)`, String.raw`\(4\pi\sqrt3\)`, String.raw`\(8\pi\)`, String.raw`\(8\pi\sqrt3\)`, "NOTA"],
    answer: "D",
    solution: String.raw`The ellipse is horizontal, so it has equation
\[\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1.\]
Because the focal distance is \(c=2\),
\[a^2-b^2=4.\]
Since \((2,3)\) lies on the ellipse,
\[\frac4{a^2}+\frac9{b^2}=1.\]
Solving gives \(a^2=16\) and \(b^2=12\), so \(a=4\) and \(b=2\sqrt3\). Therefore the area is
\[\pi ab=\pi(4)(2\sqrt3)=\boxed{8\pi\sqrt3}.\]`,

    solution: String.raw`Let \(a=\cos x\). Using \(\tan^2x=\sec^2x-1\), multiply the equation by \(a^2\) to obtain
\[16a^3+12a^2-1=0.\]
Factoring gives
\[(2a+1)^2(4a-1)=0.\]

Their product is \(\boxed{\frac{3\sqrt5}{8}}\).`,

    answer: "A",
    solution: String.raw`First, \(\angle C=80^\circ\). By the Law of Sines,
\[\frac{AC}{\sin70^\circ}=\frac{BC}{\sin30^\circ},\]
so \(AC=2\sin70^\circ\). Therefore
\[[\triangle ABC]=\frac12(BC)(AC)\sin80^\circ=\sin70^\circ\sin80^\circ.\]
Using product-to-sum,
\[\sin70^\circ\sin80^\circ=\frac12\left(\cos10^\circ-\cos150^\circ\right)=\frac12\cos10^\circ+\frac{\sqrt3}{4}.\]

\[\tan\alpha=\frac1r,\qquad \tan\beta=\frac3r,\qquad \tan\gamma=\frac2r,\qquad \tan\delta=\frac3r.\]
Because the four half-angles sum to \(\pi\),
\[\tan(\alpha+\beta+\gamma+\delta)=0.\]
Equivalently, the imaginary part of

\[\begin{pmatrix}x&y\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}2&-7/2\\-7/2&-22\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix}=1.\]
The matrix has eigenvalues \(5/2\) and \(-45/2\). An eigenvector for \(5/2\) satisfies \(x=-7y\), so this eigendirection has negative slope and is therefore the given transverse axis. Rotating to coordinates \((u,v)\) along the two eigendirections gives
\[\frac52u^2-\frac{45}{2}v^2=1,
\qquad
\frac{u^2}{2/5}-\frac{v^2}{2/45}=1.\]
Thus \(a^2=2/5\) and \(b^2=2/45\). For a hyperbola, \(c^2=a^2+b^2\), where the foci are \(2c\) apart and the vertices are \(2a\) apart. Therefore

By change of base, the left side is \(\log_x(4\cdot8\cdot16\cdot128)=\log_x(2^{16})\). Thus \(x^{16}=2^{16}\), and the domain requires \(x>0\), so \(x=2\). There are \(2\) real solutions.`,

Find the area (in square meters) of the region in which the robot may travel.`,
   choices: [String.raw`\(15\pi\)`, String.raw`\(16\pi\)`, String.raw`\(60\pi\)`, String.raw`\(80\pi\)`, "NOTA"],
   answer: "A",
   solution: String.raw`The constraint (sum of distances \(\leq 10)\) describes the interior of an ellipse with foci at the stakes.
The major axis has length \(2a=10\Rightarrow a=5\). The distance between foci is \(2c=8\Rightarrow c=4\).
\[b^2=a^2-c^2=25-16=9\Rightarrow b=3.\]
Area of ellipse \(=\pi ab=\pi(5)(3)=\boxed{15\pi}\) square meters.`,

   answer: "B",
   solution: String.raw`Using \(\tan(\pi/4)=1\) and the addition formula \(\tan(\pi/9+5\pi/36)=\tan(\pi/4)=1\):
\[1=\frac{\tan(\pi/9)+\tan(5\pi/36)}{1-\tan(\pi/9)\tan(5\pi/36)}.\]
This gives \(\tan(5\pi/36)=\dfrac{1-\tan(\pi/9)}{1+\tan(\pi/9)}\). Substituting:
\[\tan\theta=\frac{\dfrac{1-\tan(\pi/9)}{1+\tan(\pi/9)}-1}{\tan(\pi/9)-1}=\frac{-2\tan(\pi/9)}{(1+\tan(\pi/9))(\tan(\pi/9)-1)}=\frac{2\tan(\pi/9)}{1-\tan^2(\pi/9)}=\tan\!\left(\frac{2\pi}{9}\right).\]

   solution: String.raw`Compute \(h(x)=4g(f(x))=4\cdot\dfrac{2x}{4-(2x)^2}=\dfrac{8x}{4-4x^2}=\dfrac{2x}{1-x^2}\).
This is the double-angle formula for tangent: \(\dfrac{2\tan\theta}{1-\tan^2\theta}=\tan(2\theta)\).
Setting \(x=\tan\theta\): \(h(\tan\theta)=\tan(2\theta)\), so \(h^n(\tan\theta)=\tan(2^n\theta)\).
Since \(\sqrt{3}=\tan(\pi/3)\): \(h^{100}(\sqrt{3})=\tan\!\left(\dfrac{2^{100}\pi}{3}\right)\).
Now \(2^{100}\bmod 3\): since \(2\equiv -1\pmod{3}, 2^{100}\equiv(-1)^{100}=1\pmod{3}\).
So \(\dfrac{2^{100}\pi}{3}=k\pi+\dfrac{\pi}{3}\) for some integer k, and \(\tan\!\left(k\pi+\dfrac{\pi}{3}\right)=\tan\!\left(\dfrac{\pi}{3}\right)=\boxed{\sqrt{3}}\).`,

The angles \((2n-1)^{\circ}\) for \(n=1,\ldots,45\) are \(1^{\circ},3^{\circ},\ldots,89^{\circ}\). Since \(\tan\theta\cdot\tan(90^{\circ}-\theta)=1\), the product of all these tangents equals 1, so \(\sum_{n=1}^{45}\log\tan(2n-1)^{\circ}=0\).

   choices: ["1", String.raw`\(\frac{5}{4}\)`, String.raw`\(\frac{3}{2}\)`, String.raw`\(\frac{7}{4}\)`, "NOTA"],
   answer: "B",
   solution: String.raw`Let the downward-opening parabola be \(y=-x^2+c\); its latus rectum has length 1. By symmetry, write the circle's center as (0,k) and a tangency point as \((t,c-t^2)\).
The parabola has slope -2t there. The circle \(x^2+(y-k)^2=1\) has slope \(-\frac{x}{y-k}\), so tangency gives
\(-2t=-\frac{t}{c-t^2-k}\Rightarrow c-t^2-k=\frac{1}{2}\).
Because the tangency point is one radius from the center,
\(t^2+\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2=1\Rightarrow t^2=\frac{3}{4}\).
Thus \(k=c-t^2-\frac{1}{2}=c-\frac{5}{4}\). The distance from the center to the vertex (0,c) is therefore
\(c-k=\boxed{\frac{5}{4}}\),
so the answer is \(\frac{5}{4}\).

\[

g(x)=a(x+5)(x-2)(x-3)(x-7).

Its constant term is \(-210a\), so \(-210a=105\) and \(a=-\frac12\). The sum of a polynomial's coefficients is \(g(1)\):

  answer: "C",
  solution: String.raw`Under the given condition, the first two rolls must be distinct, and then the third roll is uniquely determined by their difference. Thus there are \(6\cdot5=30\) equally likely valid ordered triples.

There are \(6\) triples whose third roll is \(3\), corresponding to ordered first-roll pairs with difference \(3\). There are \(5\) valid triples with first roll \(3\) and \(5\) with second roll \(3\). The triples \((3,6,3)\) and \((6,3,3)\) have each been counted twice, so inclusion-exclusion gives
\[
6+5+5-2=14
\]
favorable triples. The conditional probability is
\[
\frac{14}{30}=\frac{7}{15}.

Therefore the answer is \(\boxed{\text{C}}\).`,

\[
YW:WZ=XY:XZ=4:1.

Write \(YW=4a\) and \(WZ=a\). The intersecting chords \(XK\) and \(YZ\) meet at \(W\), so
\[
XW\cdot WK=YW\cdot WZ.

Thus \(36=(4a)(a)=4a^2\), giving \(a=3\). Therefore

\[
5+4\sin x\cos^2x=5\sin x+8\cos^2x.

With \(s=\sin x\) and \(\cos^2x=1-s^2\), this becomes
\[
4s^3-8s^2+s+3=0
=(s-1)(2s-3)(2s+1).

The value \(s=\frac32\) is impossible, and \(s=1\) occurs where \(\cos x=0\), outside the original domains. Thus \(\sin x=-\frac12\), giving \(x=\frac{7\pi}{6},\frac{11\pi}{6}\). The corresponding \(y\)-values are

&=(M-U-3)(M+U+3)(M-U+3)(M+U-3).

The denominator factors as
\[
\begin{aligned}
M^2-U^2-6M+9&=(M-U-3)(M+U-3),\\
M^2+3M+3U-U^2&=(M+U)(M-U+3).

  answer: "C",
  solution: String.raw`Place \(I=(0,0)\) and \(W=(3\sqrt3,0)\). Since \(IG=4\) and its direction is \(150^\circ\),
\[
G=(4\cos150^\circ,4\sin150^\circ)=(-2\sqrt3,2).
\]
The line through \(W\) perpendicular to \(WI\) is \(x=3\sqrt3\). A direction perpendicular to \(IG\) is \((2,2\sqrt3)\), so the other line is
\[
(-2\sqrt3,2)+t(2,2\sqrt3).
\]
Setting its \(x\)-coordinate equal to \(3\sqrt3\) gives \(t=\frac{5\sqrt3}{2}\), hence \(J=(3\sqrt3,17)\). Applying the Shoelace Theorem to \(J,W,I,G\) gives
